    
In the previous tasks, we explored frameworks that tell you *how* to conduct a penetration test: how to scope it, progress through phases, and report your findings. But consider this situation: you have just completed an engagement using PTES, and the report documents that you gained initial access through a phishing email, escalated privileges by exploiting a misconfigured service, moved laterally using stolen credentials, and exfiltrated data through an encrypted channel. Your client reads the report and asks a deceptively simple question: *"How does our exposure compare to what real threat actors are actually doing in the wild?"*

That question is difficult to answer with a penetration testing framework alone. Frameworks like PTES and OSSTMM structure your testing process, but they do not systematically catalog the specific tactics and techniques that real-world adversaries use. This is the gap that **MITRE ATT&CK** fills.

**ATT&CK** stands for **Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge**. Developed and maintained by **The MITRE Corporation** (opens in new tab), it is not a traditional penetration testing framework. It is a **knowledge base of adversary behavior**, built from real-world observations of how threat actors operate. It catalogs *what* attackers do, organized in a structure that security professionals can use for threat intelligence, detection engineering, red teaming, and — relevant to this room — enriching penetration test findings.

## The Matrix: Tactics, Techniques, and Sub-Techniques

ATT&CK is organized as a **matrix**. Think of it as a large table. The **columns** represent **tactics**, which are the adversary's high-level objectives — the *why* behind an action. The current Enterprise matrix includes 14 tactics, progressing from **Initial Access** through **Execution**, **Persistence**, **Privilege Escalation**, **Defense Evasion**, **Credential Access**, **Discovery**, **Lateral Movement**, **Collection**, **Command and Control**, **Exfiltration**, and **Impact**.

Within each tactic column, the **rows** list **techniques** — the *how* — the specific methods an adversary uses to achieve that tactical objective. For example, under the **Initial Access** tactic, you will find techniques like **Phishing (T1566)** , **Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)** , and **Valid Accounts (T1078)**. Many techniques are further broken down into **sub-techniques**. *Phishing*, for instance, has sub-techniques for **Spearphishing Attachments (T1566.001)** , **Spearphishing Links (T1566.002)** , and **Spearphishing via Service (T1566.003)**.

Each technique entry in the ATT&CK knowledge base includes a description, real-world examples of threat groups that have used it, detection recommendations, and mitigations. This is what makes ATT&CK more than a taxonomy; it is a living reference tied to observed adversary behavior.

## ATT&CK as a Complement, Not a Replacement

Here is the key distinction: **ATT&CK does not tell you how to run a penetration test.** It does not define phases, scoping procedures, or reporting formats. Instead, it provides a **common language** for describing *what* you found during a test conducted using any framework.

Consider the analogy of a medical dictionary versus a diagnostic procedure. PTES is like the diagnostic procedure: it tells the doctor what steps to follow during an examination. ATT&CK is like the medical dictionary: it provides standardized terminology for naming and categorizing what the doctor observes. You need both, but they serve different purposes.

## Walkthrough: Mapping Findings to ATT&CK

Let's see how this works in practice. Recall the **MedGuard Health** engagement from the PTES section. Here is how the key findings from that engagement map to ATT&CK technique IDs:

| Engagement Finding | ATT&CK Tactic | ATT&CK Technique |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Phishing email delivered payload to employee workstation | Initial Access | Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001) |
| Exploited Tomcat deserialization flaw on patient portal | Initial Access | Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190) |
| Extracted cached domain credentials from workstation | Credential Access | OS Credential Dumping (T1003) |
| Moved from workstation to file server using stolen credentials | Lateral Movement | Use Alternate Authentication Material (T1550) |
| Accessed patient records database from compromised portal server | Collection | Data from Information Repositories (T1213) |

By annotating a PTES report with ATT&CK technique IDs, the tester provides MedGuard's security team with actionable insights beyond patching individual vulnerabilities. The client can now look up each technique in the ATT&CK knowledge base, review the detection guidance, and build or validate detection rules for those specific behaviors. The conversation shifts from *"fix this one bug"* to *"can we detect this class of adversary behavior?"*

## Closing Notes

ATT&CK's strength lies in its role as a **universal translator of adversary behavior**. It enables penetration testers, threat intelligence analysts, detection engineers, and incident responders to speak the same language. For penetration testers specifically, mapping findings to ATT&CK elevates a report from a list of vulnerabilities to a narrative grounded in real-world threat behavior.

The knowledge base is extensive, and mastering it takes time. The Enterprise matrix alone contains over 200 techniques. For a deeper, hands-on exploration of ATT&CK, including how to navigate the matrix, research specific threat groups, and apply it to detection engineering, dedicated rooms later in the TryHackMe platform cover ATT&CK in far greater detail. For now, the essential takeaway is this: **ATT&CK complements your chosen penetration testing framework by providing a standardized vocabulary for what you find.**
