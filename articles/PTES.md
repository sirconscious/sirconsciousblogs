You have now seen frameworks that emphasize scientific metrics (OSSTMM), web application coverage (OWASP WSTG), and government-aligned assessment techniques (NIST SP 800-115). But here is a question worth considering: if you were hired tomorrow for a standard penetration testing engagement against a corporate network, which framework would most closely mirror the actual workflow you would follow from the first client call to the final report delivery?

For many working pentesters, the answer is the **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)**. Available at [pentest-standard.org](http://www.pentest-standard.org) (opens in new tab), PTES was developed by a group of experienced security practitioners with a specific goal: **to define what a real penetration test looks like, end-to-end**. Where other frameworks focus on what to test or how to measure, PTES focuses on how the engagement flows from start to finish.

PTES is organized into **seven phases** that map directly to the lifecycle of a penetration testing engagement. This approach makes it exceptionally practical for junior testers because it answers the question that many frameworks leave implicit: *"I have a signed contract; now what do I do on day one, day two, and every day after?"*

## Phases: A Walkthrough

Let's walk through the seven phases using a scenario: a healthcare company, **MedGuard Health**, has hired your team to perform a full penetration test of their corporate network and patient records portal.

### Phase 1: Pre-Engagement Interactions

This is everything that happens before testing begins. You define the scope with MedGuard's IT director: the corporate LAN (`10.10.0.0/16`), the patient portal at `records.medguard-health.thm`, and wireless networks at the headquarters building. You document the rules of engagement, including testing windows (weeknights only to avoid disrupting clinical operations), emergency contacts, and a "get out of jail free" letter authorizing the test. PTES is notably detailed here because unclear scoping is the number one source of legal and professional disputes in penetration testing.

### Phase 2: Intelligence Gathering

You collect information about MedGuard using both passive and active techniques. Passive reconnaissance includes harvesting employee email addresses from LinkedIn, discovering subdomains through certificate transparency logs, and reviewing job postings that reveal technology stacks ("seeking a DBA with Oracle 19c experience"). Active reconnaissance involves DNS enumeration and network scanning within the agreed scope. PTES distinguishes between these levels because the depth of intelligence gathering directly shapes the quality of the subsequent phases.

### Phase 3: Threat Modeling

Using the intelligence gathered, you identify the most valuable targets and the most likely attack paths. At MedGuard, the patient records database is the highest-value asset. Your threat model identifies two primary attack paths: compromising the patient portal directly through a web vulnerability, or pivoting through the corporate LAN after compromising an employee workstation. This phase ensures your testing effort is directed by adversarial logic rather than random scanning.

### Phase 4: Vulnerability Analysis

You systematically identify weaknesses that could enable the attack paths from your threat model. At MedGuard, vulnerability scanning reveals that the patient portal is running an outdated version of Tomcat, which contains a known deserialization vulnerability. On the internal network, several workstations are missing critical patches. PTES emphasizes that vulnerability analysis includes both automated scanning and manual verification to eliminate false positives.

### Phase 5: Exploitation

You attempt to exploit the confirmed vulnerabilities. At MedGuard, you exploit the Tomcat deserialization flaw to gain a shell on the portal server. On the internal side, you use a phishing pretext (authorized in the scope) to deliver a payload to an employee workstation. PTES stresses that exploitation should be purposeful: the goal is to demonstrate business impact, not to "pop boxes" for the sake of it.

### Phase 6: Post-Exploitation

After gaining access, you determine the real-world impact. From the compromised portal server, you pivot into the backend database and confirm read access to patient records. From the employee workstation, you extract cached domain credentials and demonstrate lateral movement to a file server containing financial data. PTES treats post-exploitation as the phase where technical findings are translated into business risk: *"we accessed 50,000 patient records"* carries far more weight than *"we got a shell."*

### Phase 7: Reporting

You deliver the findings in a structured report with two audiences in mind. The **executive summary** communicates business risk in plain language for MedGuard's leadership: patient data was accessible, regulatory exposure under HIPAA is significant, and remediation is urgent. The **technical report** provides the details that MedGuard's IT team needs to reproduce and fix each finding: exact exploitation steps, affected hosts, evidence screenshots, and prioritized remediation guidance.

## Closing Notes

PTES's greatest strength is its practical, end-to-end structure. It reads like a playbook for how engagements actually unfold, which makes it an excellent learning framework for junior testers building their workflow instincts. Its detailed treatment of pre-engagement interactions is particularly valuable; many frameworks gloss over scoping and legal authorization, which are precisely the areas where inexperienced testers make costly mistakes.

On the downside, PTES has not been formally updated in several years, and the technical guidance sections reference outdated tools and techniques. The methodology and phase structure remain sound, but testers should supplement PTES's tool-specific guidance with current documentation. It also lacks the quantitative metrics of OSSTMM, so results depend more on the individual tester's judgment.
